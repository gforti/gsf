 Note that everyone must be on the same network/WiFi. `Chrome` is the recommend web browser.

> `Buzzer Players` will run on `http://localhost:3000/` 

> `Host` will run on `http://localhost:3000/host`

> `Tech` will run on `http://localhost:3000/tech`

> `View` will run on `http://localhost:3000/view`

`localhost` for the `Buzzer Players` should be replaced with the IP address that is shown on the `host` web page

There is an option in the code to password protect the tech and the host url.
